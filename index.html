        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Tennessee, located in the southeastern region of the United States,
            is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and vibrant music scene.
            The state is often celebrated as the birthplace of several musical genres,
            including blues, country, and rock 'n' roll.
            Cities like Nashville, famously dubbed "Music City," and Memphis,
            home to Beale Street and Sun Studio, are pivotal in shaping America's musical landscape.
            Nashville is also the hub of the country music industry,
            hosting the annual Country Music Association Awards and the Grand Ole Opry,
            while Memphis honors its musical legacy through institutions
            like the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to its musical roots, Tennessee boasts stunning natural beauty,
            with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park being the most visited national park in the United States.
            The park features diverse wildlife, lush forests, and a range of outdoor activities,
            from hiking to camping. Tennessee's economy is bolstered by industries such as
            agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing, making it a dynamic place
            for both residents and visitors. The state also has a rich history,
            from its role in the Civil War to its significance in the civil rights movement,
            reflected in sites like the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis.
            Overall, Tennessee offers a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty,
            making it a fascinating place to explore.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee is the oldest registered
                distillery in the United States. Lynchburg, surprisingly, is a dry county, however,
                which means you cannot buy alcohol there.</li>
            <li>Elvis Presley's house, Graceland, is the second most visited house museum
                in the United States behind only the White House. Graceland sees over 600,000
                visitors annually.</li>
